  <name>Task 1: Deploy privacy policy and submit to Chrome Web Store</name>
  <what-built>
Plan 06-01 produced:
- `docs/privacy-policy.html` — complete privacy policy ready for hosting
- `.output/` — Chrome Web Store-ready .zip package (version 1.0.0)
- Storage error handling in settings UI
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>

**Step 1: Deploy privacy policy**
- Host `docs/privacy-policy.html` at a public URL (GitHub Pages recommended: push to a `gh-pages` branch or enable Pages on the repo's `docs/` folder)
- Verify the URL loads in an incognito window

**Step 2: Prepare screenshots (1280x800 px)**
Capture 3-5 screenshots at exactly 1280x800 pixels:
1. Popup converter — encode tab with sample text and invisible output
2. Popup converter — decode tab showing invisible text revealed
3. Page scanner highlighting hidden characters on a web page
4. Settings page showing snippet management
5. Export JSON button in popup with scan results

**Step 3: Chrome Web Store Developer Dashboard**
Go to https://chrome.google.com/webstore/devconsole (requires $5 registration if not already registered)

Upload the .zip from `.output/` and fill in:

**Listing tab:**
- Detailed description:
  ```
  Detect and reveal hidden Unicode characters on any web page. InvisibleUnicode protects you from invisible prompt injection attacks, AI watermarks, and hidden text that's invisible to the human eye.

  Features:
  - Scan any page to find hidden Unicode characters (Tags block, zero-width, AI watermarks)
  - Three-class detection with color-coded highlighting
  - Encode text to invisible Unicode and decode it back
  - Save named snippets with keyboard shortcuts for quick paste
  - Export scan results as JSON
  - Configurable scan modes: on-demand or automatic
  - All processing happens locally — no data ever leaves your browser

  Built for security researchers, developers, and anyone who wants to see what's hidden in plain text.
  ```
- Primary category: **Developer Tools**
- Language: English

**Privacy practices tab:**
- Single purpose: "Detect and reveal hidden Unicode characters on web pages"
- Permission justifications:
  - **activeTab**: "Grants temporary access to the current tab only when the user clicks the extension icon or uses a keyboard shortcut. Used to inject the content script that scans the visible page for hidden Unicode characters. No background access to any tabs or browsing history."
  - **scripting**: "Required to inject the page scanner content script into the active tab. The scanner detects invisible Unicode characters (Tags block, zero-width, AI watermarks) and highlights them inline. No scripts are injected without user action."
  - **storage**: "Stores user preferences (scan mode, highlight color, snippet library) using Chrome's built-in sync storage. No data is sent to external servers. Settings sync across the user's Chrome devices via Chrome's own sync infrastructure."
- Data disclosure: Certify that NO personal data is collected
- Remote code: Select "No, I am not using remote code"
- Privacy policy URL: [your deployed URL from Step 1]

**Distribution tab:**
- Visibility: Public
- Distribution: All regions

Click "Submit for review".

**Step 4: Wait for review (24-72 hours typically)**
If rejected, review the rejection email and address specific issues.
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>
Provide the Chrome Web Store listing URL once the extension is published, or describe any rejection issues that need to be addressed.
