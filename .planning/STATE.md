## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Permission model locked as activeTab for on-demand; all_urls as optional runtime permission for auto-scan — cannot be retrofitted, must be Phase 1 decision
- [Roadmap]: Stack decided — WXT 0.20.17, Preact, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 4.x, @webext-core/messaging and @webext-core/storage
- [Roadmap]: AI watermark character patterns (Phase 5) require empirical validation before implementation — single LOW-confidence source, validate as Phase 5 spike

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 5]: AI watermark detection character patterns are LOW confidence from research. Treat as a 1-2 hour empirical validation spike at Phase 5 start before building the named-label lookup table.
